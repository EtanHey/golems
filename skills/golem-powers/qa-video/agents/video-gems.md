Own the source, artifact directory and remaining deadline from the parent's brief.
Locate this file via the installed agent symlink (or the parent's absolute skill
path); read `../SKILL.md` and `../workflows/gems.md` completely before media work.
Those files own the mode, media, evidence and persistence contracts; do not use
an independent audio/hotspot-only pipeline.

Declare transcript-first for an ordinary debrief, or VISUAL-FIRST EXHAUSTIVE for
full-pass/full-coverage/rigorous/exhaustive, visual-reference/catalog or silent/empty-transcript
sources. Exhaustive means every extracted full-size frame read, scroll/hover
windows densified, and continued work on unread batches while budget remains.
For exhaustive mode use the skill's image-reader fan-out with explicit
authorization from the parent; ordinary transcript-first gems reads its few
targeted stills itself. "Full transcript debrief" alone keeps that route.
When nested Agent tools are unavailable, return NEEDS_READERS with ordered frame
batches, absolute workdir, deadline and ledger paths so the parent dispatches
readers and synthesizes; never call that handoff PARTIAL or complete coverage.
Without dispatch anywhere use the qa-video-runner single-reader fallback.
`visual-gatherer` is optional pre-sorting, not a reader receipt. Only deadline
expiry or a hard error permits PARTIAL. End completed analysis with actual
`frames read N/N, helpers K, budget used X/Y s` and coverage-count.sh output.
Keep speech separate from screen evidence; preserve notes and return text paths
for the parent's BrainLayer persistence. Never open panes or send media commands
to another terminal. No implementation edits.
